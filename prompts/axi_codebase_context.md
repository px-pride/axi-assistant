# Axi Assistant — Development Context

This file is appended to the system prompt for agents working on the axi-assistant codebase.

## Architecture

- **Axi Prime**: Main bot at %(bot_dir)s (branch `main`, service `axi-bot.service`)
- **Disposable test instances**: Managed by `axi_test.py` CLI, git worktrees in `/home/ubuntu/axi-tests/<name>/`
- Each test instance has its own worktree, `.env`, venv, data dir, and systemd service (`axi-test@<name>`)
- Config at `~/.config/axi/test-config.json` (bots, guilds, defaults)
- See [test-system.md](test-system.md) for details

## Key Files

- `bot.py` — Main bot code (all instances run same code, behavior differs via env vars)
- `supervisor.py` — Process supervisor (manages bot.py lifecycle)
- `handlers.py` — Agent handler (lifecycle, message routing through /soul flowchart)
- `axi_test.py` — CLI for test instances (up/down/restart/list/merge/msg/logs)
- `axi-test@.service` — Systemd template unit for test instances
- `prompts/SOUL.md` — Shared personality prompt for all agents (identity, style, constraints)
- `prompts/axi_codebase_context.md` — This file; context for agents working on the axi codebase
- `commands/soul.json` — Core /soul flowchart (message classification, task lifecycle, hook dispatch)
- `extensions/` — Modular extensions: prompt.md (system prompt), commands/ (flowchart hooks), and/or prompt_hooks (in-prompt text injection)
- `.env` — Instance-specific config (gitignored)
- `schedules.json` — Scheduled events config

## Development Philosophy

Read `/home/ubuntu/axi-user-data/CODE-PHILOSOPHY.md` for the principles guiding this codebase: data-oriented design, mechanical sympathy (hardware awareness), explicit over convention, performance-aware, pragmatic functional programming, clear data flow, and no over-abstraction. This philosophy should inform all architectural decisions.

## Core vs Extension Boundary

Extension-specific concepts, tools, CLIs, and record IDs must never appear in core files. Keep core wording generic and let extensions provide the specific instructions.

Core files: SOUL.md, soul.json, axi_codebase_context.md, bot.py, handlers.py, supervisor.py, prompts.py


## Important Patterns

- `BOT_WORKTREES_DIR` (hardcoded `/home/ubuntu/axi-tests`) gates Discord MCP tools and worktree write access
- Permission callback: agents rooted in BOT_DIR or worktrees get write access to worktrees dir
- Bot message filter: own messages always ignored, other bots allowed if in ALLOWED_USER_IDS
- `httpx.AsyncClient` used for Discord REST API (MCP tools), not discord.py
- Agents use lazy wake/sleep pattern — sleeping agents have `client=None`
- `msg` command sends as Prime's bot (reads token from main repo `.env`)

## Test Instance Safety

- **NEVER tear down or stop a test instance created by others without explicit user approval.** Instances may be in active use by other agents or the user. Always ask first.
- When all bot tokens are in use, use `axi_test.py up <name> --wait` to reserve a slot and wait (polls every 10s, times out after 2 hours). **Do not** automatically tear down an existing instance to free a slot.
- If `--wait` times out, ask the user how to proceed.
- **Always tear down your own test instances** after you're done with them so the slot is available for other agents. Teardown procedure:
  1. Run `axi_test.py list` to identify which instances you created this session.
  2. For each instance you created, run `axi_test.py down <name>`.
  3. Run `axi_test.py list` again to verify the instances are gone.
- **NEVER restart, stop, or signal the production Axi bot process.** You must only restart your own test instances via `axi_test.py restart <name>`. Do not use `systemctl restart axi-bot`, `kill`, or any other method to restart the main bot. Only the master agent (axi-master) can restart itself via `axi_restart`. If your task requires a production restart, ask the user to do it.

## Self-Modification Workflow

You have access to a disposable test instance system. Use it to test code changes before applying them to your own running code.

### Rule: Never Edit Your Own Running Code

You must NEVER directly modify the code you are currently running (`%(bot_dir)s/bot.py`, etc.). Instead:
1. Create a test instance
2. Spawn an agent in the test worktree to make changes
3. Test the changes via Discord MCP tools
4. When verified, commit in the worktree, merge to main, and restart yourself

Humans using Claude Code on the server can edit your code directly (the supervisor has auto-rollback), but you cannot — a bad edit could crash you mid-operation.

### CLI Commands

Run these via Bash:

- **`uv run python axi_test.py up <name> [--guild GUILD] [--wait] [--wait-timeout SECS]`** — Reserve a bot/guild slot for a test instance. Writes `.env` and creates the data directory. Use `--wait` to poll until a bot token slot is available (default timeout: 2 hours).
- **`uv run python axi_test.py down <name>`** — Release a bot/guild reservation.
- **`uv run python axi_test.py restart <name>`** — Restart a test instance after code changes.
- **`uv run python axi_test.py list`** — Show all test instances and their status.
- **`uv run python axi_test.py merge [-m MSG] [--timeout SECS]`** — Squash-merge current branch into main via merge queue. Waits for queue turn, verifies fast-forward, squashes all commits into one. If main moved ahead, exits with code 1 (rebase and resubmit). No-op if already in main.
- **`uv run python axi_test.py queue [show|drop] [--all]`** — Show merge queue status, or drop entries. `drop` removes your branch; `drop --all` clears the queue.
- **`uv run python axi_test.py msg <name> "<message>" [--timeout SECS]`** — Send a message to a test instance and wait for its response.
- **`uv run python axi_test.py logs <name>`** — Tail the test instance's journal logs.

### Test Guilds

Test instances run in separate Discord guilds. Your Discord MCP tools (`discord_list_channels`, `discord_read_messages`, `discord_send_message`) work in these guilds using your own bot token.

Available test guilds (from `~/.config/axi/test-config.json`):
- **nova** — Guild ID `1475631458243710977`

### Workflow: Testing a Code Change

The parent (Axi master) prepares the working directory, then spawns an agent in it. The agent codes, tests, and ships — it never needs to reference the main repo directly.

**Parent responsibilities:**
1. Create a git worktree: `git -C %(bot_dir)s worktree add /home/ubuntu/axi-tests/<name> -b feature/<name>`
   (or reuse an existing worktree)
2. Spawn the coding agent with `cwd` set to the worktree directory

**IMPORTANT — worktree rule for code agents:**
Any agent that MIGHT edit files in the axi-assistant codebase MUST be spawned in a worktree, never directly in `%(bot_dir)s` (the live main repo). The running bot reads from main — edits there affect the live system immediately and bypass testing. When in doubt, use a worktree. Reading from a worktree costs nothing.
Exceptions: pure research agents, design-only agents, agents working on external repos, or when the user explicitly requests a specific cwd.

**Agent workflow:**
1. **Edit files** in cwd (all edits naturally go to the right place)
2. **Reserve a test slot**: `uv run python axi_test.py up <name> --wait` — only when ready to test
3. **Restart**: `uv run python axi_test.py restart <name>`
4. **Test via Discord MCP**: Use `discord_send_message` to the test guild, then `discord_wait_for_message` to wait for the bot's response
5. **Iterate**: Repeat 1-4 until it works
6. **Tear down**: `uv run python axi_test.py down <name>` — always release the slot when done testing
7. **Commit**: `git add -A && git commit -m "description"`
8. **Merge to main**: `uv run python axi_test.py merge` — submits to merge queue, waits for turn, squash-merges into main. If it exits with code 1 ("main has moved ahead"), run `git rebase main` and retry the merge.
9. **Restart**: Tell the parent to restart so it picks up the merged changes (spawned agents do NOT have `axi_restart` — only the master can restart itself)

### Fast Message Polling

For scripted test interactions, use the `discord_wait_for_message` MCP tool:
- `channel_id` — the channel to watch
- `after` — message ID to wait after (optional, defaults to latest message)
- `timeout` — max seconds to wait (default 120, max 300)

Polls every 2 seconds and returns as soon as a non-system message appears. Returns the message content and a cursor ID for chaining.

### Tips

- Instance names should be short and descriptive: `ping-test`, `schedule-fix`, `auth-refactor`
- Each test instance gets its own `.env`, venv, and data directory — fully isolated
- The test bot token can only run one instance at a time. Always use `--wait` when creating instances so you queue up if the slot is busy. If `--wait` times out, ask the user how to proceed — do **not** tear down someone else's instance
- Test instances use `Restart=on-failure` — they stay stopped when you stop them (unlike your own `Restart=always`)
- Crash handler and rollback are off by default on test instances (no `ENABLE_CRASH_HANDLER` or `ENABLE_ROLLBACK` set)
