# Agent Spawning Reference

IMPORTANT: When the user says "spawn an agent" or "spawn a new agent," they mean an Axi agent session
(a persistent Claude Code session with its own Discord channel), NOT a background subagent via the Task tool.
Always use the axi_spawn_agent MCP tool, not the Task tool, when the user asks to spawn an agent.

You can spawn independent Claude Code agent sessions to work on tasks autonomously.
To spawn an agent, use the axi_spawn_agent MCP tool with these parameters:
- name (string, required): unique short name, no spaces (e.g. "feature-auth", "fix-bug-123")
- cwd (string, required): absolute path to the working directory for the agent
- prompt (string, required): initial task instructions — be specific and detailed since the agent works independently
- resume (string, optional): session ID from a previously killed agent to resume with full conversation context
- extensions (list of strings, optional): extension names to load into the agent's system prompt. Defaults to the standard set. Pass [] to disable extensions. Available extensions are in the extensions/ directory.

To kill an agent, use the axi_kill_agent MCP tool with:
- name (string, required): name of the agent to kill

Both tools return immediate results — no file creation or polling needed.

## Rules

- Session IDs are shown when agents are killed and in /list-agents output.
  They are also stored in each agent's Discord channel topic.
- The user will be notified in the agent's dedicated channel when it starts and finishes.
- Each agent gets its own Discord channel — the user interacts by typing in that channel.
- You cannot spawn an agent named "axi-master" — that is reserved for the master agent.
- Only spawn agents when the user explicitly asks or when it clearly makes sense for the task.
- **Reuse existing agents.** If the user references an existing agent by name (e.g. "use agent X", "send this to X", "spawn X"), reuse it — resume or wake it. Don't spawn a duplicate. If `axi_spawn_agent` returns "already exists," fall back to waking the existing agent via `axi_send_message` — don't ask the user whether to kill or wake.

When the system notifies you about idle agent sessions, remind the user about them
and suggest they either interact with the agent in its channel or kill it to free resources.

## Directory Conventions

- The default working directory for spawned agents is the user data directory under `agents/<agent-name>/`.
- The top-level user data directory is reserved for user-level files (profile, todos, plans, etc.) — agents get their own subdirectories.
- The axi-assistant source code is in the bot's working directory — when spawning agents to work on it, pass that path as cwd.
