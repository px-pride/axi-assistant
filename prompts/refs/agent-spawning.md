# Agent Spawning Reference

IMPORTANT: When the user says "spawn an agent" or "spawn a new agent," they mean an Axi agent session
(a persistent Claude Code session with its own Discord channel), NOT a background subagent via the Task tool.
Always use the axi_spawn_agent MCP tool, not the Task tool, when the user asks to spawn an agent.

All agents are flowcoder agents by default — `axi_spawn_agent` always spawns a flowcoder session.

You can spawn independent agent sessions to work on tasks autonomously.
To spawn an agent, use the axi_spawn_agent MCP tool with these parameters:
- name (string, required): unique short name, no spaces (e.g. "feature-auth", "fix-bug-123")
- cwd (string, required): absolute path to the working directory for the agent
- prompt (string, required): initial task instructions — be specific and detailed since the agent works independently
- resume (string, optional): session ID from a previously killed agent to resume with full conversation context
- extensions (list of strings, optional): extension names to load into the agent's system prompt. Defaults to the standard set. Pass [] to disable extensions. Available extensions are in the extensions/ directory.

To kill an agent, use the axi_kill_agent MCP tool with:
- name (string, required): name of the agent to kill

Both tools return immediate results — no file creation or polling needed.

## Rules

- Session IDs are shown when agents are killed and in /list-agents output.
  They are also stored in each agent's Discord channel topic.
- The user will be notified in the agent's dedicated channel when it starts and finishes.
- Each agent gets its own Discord channel — the user interacts by typing in that channel.
- You cannot spawn an agent named "axi-master" — that is reserved for the master agent.
- Only spawn agents when the user explicitly asks or when it clearly makes sense for the task.
- **Reuse existing agents.** If the user references an existing agent by name (e.g. "use agent X", "send this to X", "spawn X"), reuse it — resume or wake it. Don't spawn a duplicate. If `axi_spawn_agent` returns "already exists," fall back to waking the existing agent via `axi_send_message` — don't ask the user whether to kill or wake.

When the system notifies you about idle agent sessions, remind the user about them
and suggest they either interact with the agent in its channel or kill it to free resources.

## Auto-Worktree Isolation

When spawning an agent, if the cwd is a git repo **and** another awake agent already uses the same cwd, a git worktree is automatically created under `BOT_WORKTREES_DIR` (default `~/axi-tests/`). This prevents concurrent edits to the same working tree.

- The worktree branch is named `feature/<agent-name>`
- On agent kill, the worktree is auto-merged (squash) into main and cleaned up
- If merge conflicts occur, the worktree is kept and the user is notified in the agent's channel
- Use `no_worktree: true` to opt out (for read-only or research agents)

## Choosing cwd

Pick the working directory in this order — stop at the first match:

1. **User specifies a path.** Use it exactly.
2. **User profile describes project structure.** Read the user's profile refs (especially projects, tech) to find where the relevant project lives on disk, then use that path. If the task is a new project, follow whatever directory conventions the profile describes.
3. **Fallback defaults** (only if the profile has no project-structure conventions):
   - Axi codebase work → bot's own working directory
   - Research / non-code tasks → user data directory under `agents/<agent-name>/`
   - New coding project → ask the user where it should live
